# chatty-app

**chatty-app** is a single-page app to allow multiple users to chat in one window. It is built using ReactJS, and it uses my related WebSockets server [chatty-server](https://github.com/ty2k/chatty-server). Both projects are coursework from [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs).

Built on top of [Lighthouse Lab's React Simple Boilerplate](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/react-simple-boilerplate?files=1).
